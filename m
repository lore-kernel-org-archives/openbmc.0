This PECI core driver should be prepared ahead of any PECI adapter
driver registration which can be called from 'kernel_init' if the
adapter driver is built-in. So this driver uses 'postcore_initcall' and
it's the reason why it can't be built as a module.

> And why do you rely on rt mutexes?

I intended to use that for giving priorities on each PECI sideband
function. For an example, Crach Dump sideband function should have a
higher priority than Temperature Monitoring sideband function. But, in
this initial implementation, it doesn't have any priority adjustment
code on the rt mutext yet so I'll remove this config dependency and will
replace rt_mutex with mutex for now. It could be replaced back with
rt_mutex later when it's actually needed.

Yes, that would be nicer. Thanks for your pointing it out. I'll add the
ioctl number and the function pointer for the reserved entries so that
the handler function can report an error value to indicate that the
command is not implemented yet.

Right, this was just for early stage debugging. Will remove it.

I see. I'll remove the access_ok().

No I didn't. I'll ask someone to do ioctl io audit on this patch and
adding a signed off tag too.

It's fully initialized at here because the peci_ping_msg struct has only
one member:

struct peci_ping_msg {
	__u8 addr;
};

This is for run-time registration of a PECI client which is connected to
a PECI bus adapter. The life cycle of this sysfs interface will be
synced with the adapter driver. Actually, it follows what I2C core
driver currently does.

I think it should print out a result on a userspace request for client
module registration.

Actually, DEVICE_ATTR_WO() is what I can use here. The reason why I used
DEVICE_ATTR() is for keeping the function naming pattern as
'peci_sysfs_new_device()' instead of 'new_device_store()'.

Same as above. This is for run-time deregistration of a PECI client
which is registered on a PECI bus adapter. The life cycle of this sysfs
interface will be synced with the adapter driver. Actually, it follows
what I2C core driver currently does.

Okay. I'll remove this printing out.

It cannot remove itself. The owner of the sysfs files is an adapter
driver and only client devices can be added/removed by these sysfs
files. An adapter can't be removed by accessing of this sysfs.

Okay, I got your point. I'll split out the character device part as
a separated module and will make the module can be attached to a PECI
bus.

>> +	int			nr;

The name in struct device is used for indicating generic PECI bus
topology like below example:

Adapter devices: 'peci-0' where 0 means bus number.
Client devices: '0-30' where 0 means bus number, 30 means hexadecimal
                        address of the client device.

These devices can be found in /sys/bus/peci/devices folder.

The name at here will contain a name which is assigned by adapter
driver. In case of Aspeed PECI adapter driver in this series, it shows
'1e78b000.peci-bus'.

It defines a constant for the PCI configuration space access through
a PECI bus. I'll add 'PECI_' at the front.

Okay. I'll add 'PECI_' for all of these.

I intended to make it as contiguous byte sequence in this order because
some PECI commands need to caclulate CRC8 checksum using this as a byte
array. I'll align these on a 32bit boundary and will use a temporary
buffer instead while calcuating a CRC8 checksum.
