What kind of "subsystem" ? There is almost no way there could be one
for that sort of BMC tunables. We've look at several BMC chips out
there and requirements from several vendors, BIOS and system
manufacturers and it's all over the place.

So what's the alternative ? Because without something like what we
propose, what's going to happen is /dev/mem ... that's what people do
today.

Well, same here, we hope to review what goes upstream to make it
reasonable. Otherwise it doens't matter. If a random vendor, let's say
IBM, chose to chip a system where they put an insane amount of cruft in
there, it will only affect those systems's BMC and the userspace stack
on it.

Thankfully that stack is OpenBMC and IBM is aiming at having their
device-tree's upstream, thus reviewed, thus it won't happen.

*Anything* can be abused. The point here is that we have a number,
thankfully rather small, maybe a dozen or two, of tunables that are
quite specific to a combination (system vendor, bmc vendor, system
model) which control a few HW features that essentially do *NOT* fit in
a subsystem.

For everything that does, we have created proper drivers (and are doing
more).

It doesn't directly influence anything external to the SoC (i.e. it's certainly not a traditional GPIO in any sense). However, it does *indirectly* influence the SoC's behaviour by muxing the DAC internally between:

This specific family of SoC (Aspeed) support those 4 configurations.
How they need to be configured at runtime depends on the combination of
system vendor and system model, along with in some cases the need to
switch it at runtime.

This is just one example. Another one is the handful of scratch
registers that need to be populated with the "right" values for the
host system BIOS, VGA BIOS and VGA driver. (The host bits access them
via LPC IO space).

The host system BIOS will read some basic config info there before its
IPMI stack is up (and some BIOSes already rely on that). The VGA BIOS
will get some strapping info and panel info. The VGA driver (which is
already upstream, has been for a long time) will look for other things
in some of these guys, such as connector configuration.

Andrew, if it helps, we could put together a list of what we typically
need on an OpenPower system today. That would give people like Rob a
better idea of what this is all about.

Most of these things is specific to a given board or may even need to
be changed at runtime.

For example the VGA mux is system specific, *and* will change at
runtime on some systems. For example, on IBM systems, the BMC will
route its internal CRT display controller to the VGA port in order to
display early boot progress information when the host hasn't
initialized its graphics driver yet, and route the host VGA to the VGA
port when the host has.

(To clarify, the BMC has 2 display controllers: one for use by the SoC
ARM itself, and one exposed to the host via PCIe, this routes which one
gets to output to the VGA port).

The scratch registers are similar. Their content tend to be specific to
a specific BIOS vendor/system manufacturer. It might need to change
from boot to boot based configuration changes the user might do via the
BMC IPMI or web interface.

Another example is that the SoC can expose a couple of PCIe devices to
the host, a given vendor will want to control whether to do that and
which ones to expose. This can be fixed or tunable. Some vendors want
the user to be able to control (via IPMI or web UI or some other
mechanism) whether the SoC internal VGA shows up or not depending on
whether they chose to use a separate discrete GPU, as some OSes get
confused when in the presence of multiple different graphic adapters.

Talking of which: Andrew, did you put "default values" in your binding
? That would be a nice way to deal with system specific immutables, so
that userspace doesn't even have to care.

So to clarify once and for all, *anything* that fits in a subsystem,
we're putting in one. All the random board control is all GPIOs and
that's fine as well. For some things that require a bit of fiddly usage
like the "MBOX" logic between BIOS and BMC we are also doing a
dedicated driver.

But there's a few stragglers here, and they tend to be so
board/system/BIOS specific that it's not sustainable to create/change
random drivers all the time just for exposing those few tunables.

Cheers,
Ben.
