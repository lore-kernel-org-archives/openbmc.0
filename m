ltc2978 (commit e04d1ce9bbb) and most of the Zilker Labs chips (zl6100.c).

You could try the approach I used in the zl6100 driver: Add a minimum time
between accesses to the chip. I would probably no longer use udelay(), though,
but usleeep_range(), if I were to implement the code today.

If you can, you might try something in between. Early TI chips (ucd9000 variants,
some sold as OEM chips to third parties) had a problem with both 100kHz and 400kHz,
but worked fine between about 150 kHz and 350 kHz, for whatever reason. Of course,
maybe that was a signal problem on our boards at the time (the i2c signal routing
was quite complex).
