Yes. I guess the hesitation was whether we should also write those
registers so we can apply the requested function.

This seems like the reasonable approach if we want to read/write those
registers. The affected IO ranges correspond to:

* SuperIO Controller (SIO)
* SOC Display Controller (GFX)
* LPC Controller (LPC)

SIO and LPC both perform a mishmash of functions and so likely would
use the mfd subsystem anyway. I don't yet have any arguments against
doing it for the GFX IO space. Joel?

I briefly experimented with the idea of accessing the other IO spaces
but it felt dirty precisely for what would have become accessor
spaghetti. So I wound up with the lame approach in this patch, which
just punts on the problem. I think the mfd/syscon approach would work
well though.

It looks like the rockchip pinctrl bindings are doing something along
the lines of what we need with the rockchip,pmu phandle property. Is it
acceptable to create three properties, a phandle to grab each regmap
for the IO spaces above?

No, seems you have understood what we need to do.

Well, presumably this engineer knows too :) And yes, I'd like to know
what constraints existed that forced this design as a solution. I'd
like my sanity back.

It doesn't represent the register layout. But saving bits also wasn't
the motivation, more avoiding a lot of code churn in the g4/g5 drivers
to populate a new member. Maybe that's a bad motivation. I'll have more
of a think about it.

Thanks for the feedback,

Andrew
