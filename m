You are right if both having slave and master active at the same time
was not possible; however, it is. Imagine the case where the slave is
receiving a request and something in the I2C API gets called. I
suppose we could make the slave IRQ handler lock that lock, but I
think it makes more sense to have a separate lock, since we do not
control that lock making it harder to reason about. Plus, we put
ourselves in a position where an API user has access to a lock that an
interrupt handler needs to acquire, if the user does something dumb,
then we can get interrupt starvation.

For timeout and cmd_err, I do not see any argument against it; it
sounds like we are in a very messed up, very unknown state, so full
reset is probably the best last resort. For SDA staying pulled down, I
think we can say with reasonable confidence that some device on our
bus is behaving very badly and I am not convinced that resetting the
controller is likely to do anything to help; that being said, I really
do not have any good ideas to address that. So maybe praying and
resetting the controller is *the most reasonable thing to do.* I would
like to know what you think we should do in that case.

While I was thinking about this I also realized that the SDA line
check after recovery happens in the else branch, but SCL line check
does not happen after we attempt to STOP if SCL is hung. If we decide
to make special note SDA being hung by a device that won't let go, we
might want to make a special note that SCL is hung by a device that
won't let go. Just a thought.

Right now I am not doing any of the protocol mangling options, but I
can add them in if you think it is important for initial support.

The documentation says to ACK the interrupt after handling in the RX case:

S/W needs to clear this status bit to allow next data receiving.

I will double check with Ryan to make sure TX works the same way.

Let me know if you still think we need a "RECOVERY" state.

I did not think that there is an SMBUS_QUICK RX. Could you point me to
an example?

In practice no, but it is probably best to be safe :-)
