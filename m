I never said they would. Saying "do not integrate well into other
driver models YET" implies at some point they will. No point in
beating this any further, just remove "yet"...

 So the SuperIO and VGA scratch registers, plus the DAC mux. A bunch of tun=
able things.

 BMC uses the VGA scratch registers to sense initialisation of the host gra=

 host VGA driver is up we switch the DAC mux from the BMC CRT device to the=
 host VGA device so that the host is now driving the VGA output. Non-OpenPO=

Not unique. Just instead of populating the structs you have in the
driver from DT, define them in the driver and attach them to
match->data ptr.

Yes, if the blocks have well defined boundaries and functions. Blocks
like a UART for example do. Various pieces dumped into system
controllers generally don't IME.

Yes. It's a judgement call as to how much we try to describe in DT. To
use clocks again, a clock divider, mux, or gate all seem like well
defined functions which could be (and were) described in DT, but we
learned that doesn't really work. We're still converting platforms
that did it that way...

 the description of the relevant system (DT, for a function, a SoC or a boa=
rd), otherwise don't we wind up with crazy, unfocused, monolithic drivers f=
or things like system controllers? (There's MFD/syscon, but having used it =
previously I'm still grappling with the benefit over some of the weirdness =
it injects into devicetree - maybe I did it wrong.) Or alternatively, a gen=
eric driver that's choc full of platform-specific data covering the platfor=
ms that require it?

If that data is one set per SoC, then i'm not that concerned having
platform-specific data in the driver. That doesn't mean the driver is
not "generic". It's still not clear to me in this thread, how much of
this is board specific, but given that you've placed all the data in
an SoC dtsi file it seems to be all per SoC.
