Of course, but please do not have your "users" use a kernel that is
known to have bugs and can not be supported.  That would not be good at
all, don't you think?

Merging vendor trees into your tree has got to be a complicated mess.
Why try to keep it all together in one place?

And who is responsible for getting the vendor code upstream?  The
individual drivers?  Individual driver submissions should be quite easy,
what is preventing them from getting merged?

What "USB CDC" do you have that is not upstream?  I'll pick on this one
specifically as I don't think I've seen any patches recently submitted
for that driver at all.  Am I just missing them?

The other ones should also all be easy to get merged, with maybe the
exception of the drm stuff due to the speed that subsystem moves at.
But even there, the community is very helpful in getting stuff upstream,
have you asked for help?

Why are you merging all SoC trees together into one place?  That seems
like a nightmare to manage, especially with git.

quilt is best for a tree that you can not rebase (i.e. a public git
tree).  Otherwise you end up getting patches all mushed together and
hard to extract in any simple way.

Take a clue from the distros that have been managing kernels for decades
and deal with an updated kernel all the time easily.

Good luck, it sounds like you will need it :)
