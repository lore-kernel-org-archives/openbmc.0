That makes sense. I'll move the common code into a single function.

This driver is implemented to support only BMC (Baseboard Management 
Controllers) chipset which is running on a separated linux kernel from a 
host server system. Through a PECI connection between them, this driver 
collects the host server system's CPU and DIMM temperature information 
which is running on a separated OS. That could be a linux, a Windows OS 
or any other OSes. I mean, there is no shared devicetree data between 
them so it is why the 'cpu_id' was added into dt configuration of this 
driver.

Using quite limited hardware connections such as PECI, KSC, eSPI and 
SMBus, the BMC manages the host server and this hwmon is one of features 
of BMC.

This devicetree attribute will be configured at runtime using dt overlay 
based on the host server's hardware configuration which will be parsed 
and managed by a userspace BMC service.

As I explained above, BMC and host server are running on separated OSes 
so this driver cannot be (actually, doesn't need to be) directly 
associated with other kernel modules in the BMC side OS for identifying 
the host server system's functionality. My thought is, this driver will 
use PECI only for identifying the host server's CPU and DIMM information 
and the userspace BMC service could deliver any additional host server 
information thru dt overlay if needed before the BMC service initiates 
this driver at runtime.

Thanks a lot,

Jae
