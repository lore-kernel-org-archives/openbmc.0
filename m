Hi,
Thanks all for the feedback; Further reimplementation of this driver will
be handled by
another member of my team. Please contact Nancy Yuen(yuenn@google.com) for
any details.
Summary of main points mentioned in the feedback were :
  - Address Russell's errno comments
  - Rebase per Joel's comment
  - Research fingerprint reader support (mentioned by Greg KH)
  - Research drivers/leds (mentioned by Arnd)
  - Reimplement either by making an API that all devices of this type could
use or in drivers/leds             model or the fingerprint reader model.

FWIW, I proposed a driver for seven segment displays back in 2013:<br>

it from userspace. See:<br>
