I don't worry about initial values too much. Those could be specified
by userspace. It would be trivial to have something akin to
/etc/sysctl.conf that contains the initial values and a script blasting
them early. In fact I prefer this being in userspace to be frank. It
could be in the initramfs if we want it done early enough, maybe with a
usermode helper.

Unless we have some demonstrable reasons why some of these must be set
before the various kernel drivers initialize.

I really only worry about the actual set of registers/fields. I think
folding in initial values goes a bit too far.

I don't worry too much about userspace containing system specific bits
and pieces such as a config file with the appropriate initial values
for the platform. Userspace will have to contain platform specific
stuff regardless (if anything, stuff like thermal control is
intrinsicly different from one platform to the next).

If the fields are in the SoC dtsi, then Rob has a reasonable argument
that the list of fields is rather fixed for a given SoC and thus could
be hard wired in the driver.... 

I think at this stage, we need to create more clarity. In order to do
that, I think we need to come up with a list, as exhaustive as we can,
of what are the fields/register we need for our platforms, and find any
reason why userspace wouldn't be a good enough location to stick the
initial values.

Then we need Dell and Yadro (and maybe others) to help with their
variant of that list for the same SoCs to begin with.

With that, we'll get an idea of whether we think we can get a
reasonable stable long term list that's appropriate for most vendors.

If that's the case, then my objections to have it in the kernel instead
of the DT fade away a bit.

If one or two of those fields absolutely must have their defaults
early, then we can consider a specific set of one or two properties in
the SoC node for that SoC family that provides those specific defaults.

But unless we have that list, I think we'll be throwing too many
hypotheticals around to convince Rob and others.

Andrew, can you start with a list that shows what you expect us to need
on our systems ?

Cheers,
Ben
