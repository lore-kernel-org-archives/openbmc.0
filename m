Then set up your dependancies correctly.  As an example, you can have
the USB core as a module, and you are not allowed to have USB drivers
built into the kernel.  It's not difficult to do this.  Please make your
core also be a module so that you do not burden the zillions of machines
out there with code that they do not need, just because you forced the
distro to choose "Y" or "N".

You are forcing your userspace tools to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN in order to
talk to your device.  Why?  What is wrong with the file permissions on
the device node instead?  Why can't userspace decide what user should be
able to talk to your device?

Don't require special permissions for no good reason.  This forces
whatever userspace tool that handles this, to have enough permission to
do anything it wants in the system.  And I do not think you want that.

Ok.  But my question about "can you do this off the stack" remains.

What i2c core driver parses configuration options in sysfs?

Ugh, I see that now.  That's horrible.  Please do not emulate that at
all.

Again, use configfs, that is what it is there for, do not spread bad
interfaces to new places in the kernel.

Why?  Who is going to do anything with this?  Userspace "knows" it
worked because their function call returned success.  It is not going to
then parse a kernel log.

Sorry, yes, WO is what you want.  But anyway, this should be in
configfs, not sysfs.

I'm not saying it has to be a whole separate module, at the least it
needs to be a new structure.  As it is, your code is not correct due to
the dual-structures-trying-to-fight-it-out-for-lifecycle-rules

If this really is the way the structure needs to be on the wire, that's
fine, it's just a complaint about the protocol and how bad accessing
those fields are going to suck for some processors.

But if you can get away with not doing it like this, that would be nice.
