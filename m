I understand your concern, of course, driver need handles things well. 
But in fact, if a user app is truly a bad boy, it still can hang
the host side: set SMS_ATN, but no message returned when software host 
side requests, then host open-ipmi driver will hang, we
meet this kind of error to hang the customer's host. :) In my 
understanding, kcs-bmc should do the right thing about read and write,
the real transaction should be handled correctly by the kcsd.

And if no kcsd starts, then this kind of BMC can't be sold out. :)
