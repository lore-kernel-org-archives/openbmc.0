Allright, I finally found some time for reviewing some of this
after splitting the ftgmac100 patch into 54 smaller ones :)

I am not entirely convinced we need that lock. The i2c core will
take a mutex protecting all operations on the bus. So we only need
to synchronize between our "xfer" code and our interrupt handler.

This probably be done without a lock if we are careful. Not a huge
deal though as Aspeed SoC are currently not SMP so the lock compiles
down to not much unless you have all the debug crap enabled :-)

Minor nit but the above should probably be in the slave patch no ?

Another very minor nit, I'm not certain those accessors are a big
win in code size and/or readability but keep them if you want.

See my comment further down in master_xfer, do the reinit before sending
the command, even if currently the lock protects you, it's cleaner.

Now, I don't completely get how your interrupt handler deals with these
"message-less" completions. See the review of the interrupt handler.

Some of those error states probably also warrant a reset of the controller,
I think aspeed does that in the SDK.

What about I2C_M_NOSTART ? 

Not that I've ever seen it used... ;-)

If your lock means anything you should probably capture bus->msgs[..]
with the lock held. That said, see my previous comment about the
lock possibly not being terribly useful.

Additionally, if you are doing a bus recovery, won't you be messing
around with a stale or NULL bus->msgs ?

I would at the very least make it

	msg = bus->msgs ? &bus->msgs[bus->msgs_index] : NULL;

That way msg is NULL in the recovery case rather than a random
crap pointer.

I would "ack" (write back to INTR_STS_REG) immediately. Otherwise
you have a race between status bits set as a result of what happened
before the interrupt handler vs. as a result of what you did.

For example, take TX. You get the TX bit in irq_status. You start
a new character transmission bcs there's more to send *then* you ack
the TX bit. That's racy. If that new transmission is fast enough,
you'll end up acking the wrong one. Again this is extremely unlikely
but code should be written in a way that is completely fool proof
from such races. They can happen for stupid reasons, such as huge
bus delays caused by a peripheral, FIQ going bonkers etc...

In general, you always ACK all interrupts first. Then you handle
the bits you have harvested.

What happen with recovery completion here ?

Won't we hit !bus->msgs && master state != stop ? Especially
if we hit a timeout where we haven't cleaned up any of our state.

> +		dev_dbg(bus->dev, "received error interrupt: 0x%08x",
> +			irq_status);

This is confusing too in the case of master_state != stop ... any
interrupt will trigger that. I think it would be worthwhile either
commenting a bit more here or having clearer messages depending
on the condition.

I would set master_state to "RECOVERY" (new state ?) and ensure
those things are caught if they happen outside of a recovery.

> +	if (bus->master_state == ASPEED_I2C_MASTER_START) {

Here a comment would be handy as to why you do this before the
switch/case. I understand why but it makes reading the code by
somebody else easier.

> +		if (!(irq_status & ASPEED_I2CD_INTR_TX_ACK)) {

Minor nit:

		if (unlikely(error case)) {
			...
			goto out;
		}
		...

Ie, you don't need the "else", and you make it clear that this
is an error case, allowing the compiler to potentially optimize
the likely branch.

In fact, I would have that on all the error cases above too.

I understand now why you have that 'status_ack'. You are trying
to catch the bits that may be set that shouldn't be.

I think you should still "ack early". However, you could have
status_ack called status_handled or something like that and
at the end, still catch "spurrious" bits.

That said, I notice a lot of duplication in your state machine.

You basically have each state starting with

	if (didn't get the bit I wanted) {
		error
	}

You are also not very consistent as to whether you generate a
stop as a result or not.

I would happily simplify that state machine by just completing
with an error and letting master_xfer() do a stop when done but
if you like to keep it the way it is, you could have a common
goto label that handle error + stop.

What about the SMBUS_QUICK case ? (0-len transfer). Do we need
to handle this here ? A quick look at the TX_FIRST case makes
me think we are ok there but I'm not sure about the RX case.

I'm not sure the RX case is tight also. What completion does the
HW give you for the address cycle ? Won't you get that before it
has received the first character ? IE. You fall through to
the read case of the state machine with the read potentially
not complete yet no ?

As I said earlier, I would factor all the error cases. I would also
not worry too much about checking that the status bits meet expectation
in the error path.

See my comment above for a bog standard i2c_read. Aren't you getting
the completion for the address before the read is even started ?

You need to error out with -EPROTO if the size is too large.

You have some duplication. You could have your "completed message,
switch to the next one" be either a helper or another goto statement.

I would do a little helper that check the index and calls stop or
start.

In theory you want to only return IRQ_HANDLED if you indeed has at
least one IRQ status bit set... Not a huge deal here but it would
be cleaner.

See previous comment about the lock.

I would also cleanup all the interrupts before we even start a transfer
(ie write all 1's to the interrupt status reg).

Minor nit: msgs_count rather than size ?

The reinit_completion call should probably be before do_start.

Currently the spinlock avoids this being a real issue but if as I
suggest you take out the lock, then it will be racy (probably
impossible to hit in practice but still .. :-)

If we timed out we may want to sanitize the HW state. I would suggest
resetting the master. We should also sanitize master_state. I would
suggest adding a reset function that cleans everything up.

As I think I mentioned earlier, the AST2500 has a slightly different
register layout which support larger values for high and low, thus
allowing a finer granularity.

BTW. In case you haven't, I would suggest you copy/paste the above in
a userspace app and run it for all frequency divisors and see if your
results match the aspeed table :)

I already discussed by doubts about the above. I can try to scope
it with the EVB if you don't get to it. For now I'd rather take the
code out.

We should ask aspeed from what frequency the "1T" stuff is useful.

Again, out of paranoia, make sure the HW is reset and interrupt
off *before* you register the interrupt handler, or a HW left in
a funny state (by uboot for example) might shoot interrupts before
you are ready to take them. I would move the reset you do below
to before devm_request_irq.

Another trivial one, should we put some kind of bus number
in that string ?

Out of paranoia, should we turn off the function and mask the
interrupts here just in case ?
