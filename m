Okay. I'll make this core config as a tristate.

Okay, I got your point now. Thank you. I'll remove this permission check
from here.

I'll add 3 bytes of dummy padding into this structure. Also, I'll check
again u32 boundary alignment for all struct defines in peci_ioctl.h.
Would it be okay to be on stack then?

Okay, I see. I'll rewrite this interface using configfs. Thanks!

Agree. Will change it to dev_dbg().

I'll rewrite this interface using configfs.

Agreed. Thanks!

For a case of debugging. Anyway, I'll rewrite this part using configfs.

I got you point clearly now. I'll use a separate structure for the
character device.

OK. I'll align this on a 32bit boundary and align all remaining
structures in this header file as well.

Thanks a lot for your comments.
