Hi Rob, Ben,

I've replied to you both inline below, hopefully it's clear enough from the context.

Right - This is the fundamental principle backing these patches: There will never be a coherent subsystem catering to any of what we want to describe with these bindings.

This matches the situation at hand.

"Not worthwhile" is what I'm pushing back against for our use cases. I think they are narrow and limited enough to make it worthwhile.

Obviously we want to avoid describing these things *badly* - you mentioned the clock bindings - so I'm happy to hash out what the right representation should be. But I struggle to think the solution is not describing some of our hardware features at all.

Yep. And I've outlined in the cover letter what I think are the advantages of what I'm proposing over /dev/mem. It's not an incredible gain, but has several of nice-to-have properties.

Exactly. I tried to head off the abuse vector by requiring that uses be listed in the bindings document, and thus enforce some level of review. It might not be the most effective approach at the end of the day, but at least it is something.

It doesn't directly influence anything external to the SoC (i.e. it's certainly not a traditional GPIO in any sense). However, it does *indirectly* influence the SoC's behaviour by muxing the DAC internally between:

It's primarily what I've outlined at the bottom of the bindings document, though the use cases aren't provided there as they are a bit out-of-scope. So the SuperIO and VGA scratch registers, plus the DAC mux. A bunch of tunable things.

OpenPOWER platforms make use of the SuperIO scratch registers to convey configuration information from the BMC to the host. Information provided includes low-level control of the host firmware initialisation process, UART and logging configuration, and the strategy for handling errors (crash vs log). This is all an "arbitrary" contract between the BMC userspace and the host firmware, i.e. different platforms/firmware could lay out the same information in different ways or communicate entirely different information altogether. The BMC kernel shouldn't care about any of it, other than provide sensible access to the hardware.

Again on OpenPOWER systems using the ASPEED BMC SoCs running OpenBMC, the BMC uses the VGA scratch registers to sense initialisation of the host graphics driver in the host's boot process. When the BMC userspace detects the host VGA driver is up we switch the DAC mux from the BMC CRT device to the host VGA device so that the host is now driving the VGA output. Non-OpenPOWER OpenBMC configurations may do something entirely different, or not do anything at all with the hardware, so as above, it's not really the job of the BMC kernel to be involved in any of this, other than to provide sensible access to userspace.

There are a number of other switches that control the availability of ASPEED BMC hardware features to the host system that also don't fit any particular subsystem and so will use these bindings, but our (OpenPOWER/OpenBMC) current uses are what's described above.

Dell also suggested they had some use-cases that aligned with the intent of the bindings, but I don't know what they had in mind. Eugene (on Cc) can elaborate.

Rob: A driver for what though? One unique to this particular mux? That feels overly specific when we can generalise the concept to cover a wider range of use-cases.

I think this last sentence identifies a difference in our starting points, so I'd like to explore that. Blocks of functionality might move around inside the SoC as well, so don't we need a way to describe those functions appropriately? And from there describe how the SoC integrates the functions, and then describe how a board integrates the SoC? This all composes, and the problem at the end of the day comes down to what we want to view as a point of abstraction, right?

It seems ideal to me that the metadata about hardware features resides in the description of the relevant system (DT, for a function, a SoC or a board), otherwise don't we wind up with crazy, unfocused, monolithic drivers for things like system controllers? (There's MFD/syscon, but having used it previously I'm still grappling with the benefit over some of the weirdness it injects into devicetree - maybe I did it wrong.) Or alternatively, a generic driver that's choc full of platform-specific data covering the platforms that require it? The driver that implements the behaviour of the bindings described here turns out quite focused (even if the first attempt was a bit of a basket case, hopefully the second is better (sorry Greg)).

Yes, I described a `default-value`property for RW fields, and `default-set` and `default-clear`properties for write-1-set/write-1-clear fields for exactly this purpose.

(As an aside, the "MBOX" functionality is slightly different from the scratch registers in that it has configurable interrupts each way (BMC-to-Host and Host-to-BMC) - as such it can be used to implement a dynamic protocol and so deserves its own driver. This is in contrast to the dumb scratch registers we're describing with these bindings which have no such interrupts.)

Yes, this is my feeling too.
