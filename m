I'm ok with doing this, but I lied about the patch being fine, there are 
some issue.
Well, I didn't lie, but I didn't look closely enough.

Can you use dev_xxx() instead of pr_xxx().  I know the driver isn't 
currently
consistent, but there are a number of patches I have pending to make it
better and it's a longer-term goal.

Can you make GET_DEVICE_ID_ATTEMPTS more specific, add IPMI_SI_ to
the beginning or something.

I am not sure that I'm ok with waiting up to 1.25 seconds in the init 
function.
As I mentioned before, a large number of systems have broken ACPI/SMBIOS
information, and for those it will add 1.25 seconds to the boot time of 
every
one of those systems.  That won't make me a popular guy :-).

This is a harder problem to figure out what to do.  To solve it properly 
would
mean having a timer or thread drive this, and unload the module later if
the process fails.
