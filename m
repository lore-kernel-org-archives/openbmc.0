4.13?  Why that kernel?  It too is obsolete and insecure and
unsupported.

What keeps you all from just always tracking the latest tree from Linus?
What is in your tree that is not upstream that requires you to have a
kernel tree at all?

And if you do have out-of-tree code, why not use a process that makes it
trivial to update the base kernel version so that you can keep up to
date very easily?  (hint, just using 'git' is not a good way to do
this...)
