This has nothing to do with any kernel guarantee. Not sure what you are
mixing up here :-)

The IDs will get exposed via sysfs in order to allow udev rules to
create appropriate symlinks such as by-id or by-path as is traditional
(we haven't completely decided some of the udev side details yet)

This is necessary, though Aliases may do the job too. This is the
device-tree that represents the "host" system that the BMC is managing.

We need to be able to identify using a stable numbering scheme the
processors on the FSI topology otherwise we would do "interesting"
things such as turn the fan for CPU 1 when CPU 0 gets hot :-)

(This is just a silly example, there are plenty of other reasons why we
need to understand the HW topology of a given system, including
debuggers using FSI as a backend etc...)

Traditionally POWER has used ibm,chip-id properties for the host side,
so I just did something similar here for the BMC side, but I can look
into using aliases if you prefer.

Note: I'm not sure what you have against DT provided names or IDs, this
has been a rather standard way of doing things even before we did the
FDT. For example that's what slot-names properties are for, or location
codes etc... Yes we invented that alias trick later on but it's not
necessarily the best approach (in fact I don't really like it to be
honest).

Cheers,
Ben.
