> Marek, thank you for asking all these questions. They made me conduct a deeper investigation than just finding the commit that broke it and reverting it. It appears that OpenPOWER P8's SBE code (the thing that P8 CPU runs first from its built-in memory) expects the PNOR flash chip to be in EN4B mode. It reads the rest of OpenPOWER Firmware using a usual READ (0x03) command with 4 bytes of address. Always. That's why, I believe, Roman's commit broke host booting for us.

Uh oh, I seem to remember some flashes had this weird quirk where they
were in EN4B mode by default, and if U-Boot/Linux reset the flash into
"sane default" state (3B addressing etc), some systems failed to boot.
Furthermore, this EN4B is non-volatile bit on this flash, right ? That
means it is retained across power-cycles, which sucks even more.

> Probably it would be best not to merge this patch into Linux kernel. I'll discuss it with colleagues from OpenPOWER community and we'll probably fix it on SBE side.

Can you fix the firmware ? If so, that'd be amazing.
But still, there can be a software which does rogue transmission on the
SPI bus and flips the flash into 3B mode before reset, so the system
will not boot anyway. Do you have a way to deal with that somehow ?

A patch would be nice, yes.
