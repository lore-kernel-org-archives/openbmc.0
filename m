Oh, memcpy won't fail as long as the source and destination is kernel 
memory.
I was a little confused by the access_ok() thing, it's common for people to
assume that if they do access_ok(), that copy_to_user() won't fail.

It's good practice to keep larger things off the stack, which is why I 
dynamically
allocated it.  But if you have a mutex, you can put that buffer in 
struct bt_bmc
since it would only be accessed when holding the mutex.
