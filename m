Hello team,
I am new to OpenBMC. I want to development image for the machine using the
OpenBMC/Yocto build system, available firmware information, and readings
from the existing BMC.

Since the original BMC firmware has limited access and the motherboard
schematic is not available to me, I would appreciate your guidance on the
recommended approach for developing and validating a reliable OpenBMC image
for this board.

I have the following questions:

1. Hardware documentation required
=E2=80=A2 What documents are normally required before starting an OpenBMC p=
ort for
a new motherboard?
=E2=80=A2 Is the motherboard user manual sufficient, or do we also need the
motherboard schematic, BMC datasheet, hardware design guide, component
datasheets, and board-specific signal mappings?
=E2=80=A2 for example the CPU schematic and AST(BmC) reference schematic ar=
e
available but the motherboard schematic is missing, how much of the
required hardware configuration can be established from them?
=E2=80=A2 Since my target board uses the ASTs BmC, which specific datasheet=
s or
hardware design documents should I obtain?

2. Extracting information from existing BMC firmware
=E2=80=A2 If the original BMC firmware is available only as a binary and it=
s Linux
shell or source code is restricted, what information can reliably be
extracted from the image?
=E2=80=A2 Can we identify the flash layout, device tree, GPIO configuration=
, I=C2=B2C
devices, sensor definitions, fan configuration, Ethernet settings, and
board identity?
=E2=80=A2 Which details can be confirmed from firmware, and which require t=
he
motherboard schematic or physical measurements?

3. GPIO and hardware configuration
=E2=80=A2 How can we verify GPIO connections, signal polarity, direction, t=
iming,
and safe initial states without the motherboard schematic?
=E2=80=A2 How can we identify the actual I=C2=B2C bus routing, multiplexers=
, device
addresses, and peripheral protocols?
=E2=80=A2 What is the recommended method for verifying voltage-divider valu=
es, ADC
scaling, and temperature sensor configuration?
=E2=80=A2 How should fan PWM/tachometer mappings, fan zones, minimum safe s=
peeds,
and failsafe behavior be established?
=E2=80=A2 How can the LED wiring, Ethernet PHY address/reset configuration,=
 and
NCSI connections be verified?

4. OpenBMC image development
=E2=80=A2 What is the recommended workflow for creating a new OpenBMC machi=
ne
configuration, device tree, Yocto layer, sensor configuration, and required
services?
=E2=80=A2 Are there existing OpenBMC reference boards or porting guides tha=
t would
be useful for this type of project?
=E2=80=A2 Can we proceed with firmware analysis and QEMU testing while some
hardware details remain unknown?
=E2=80=A2 Which functions can be validated in QEMU, and which must be teste=
d on the
physical motherboard?

5. Flashing and recovery
=E2=80=A2 If the original BMC firmware source code is unavailable, can a cu=
stom
OpenBMC image still be developed and flashed safely?
=E2=80=A2 How should the original SPI flash be backed up, the flash layout =
and
image size verified, and a recovery procedure prepared?
=E2=80=A2 What checks should be completed before writing the image to the p=
hysical
BMC?
=E2=80=A2 If the image boots but networking, fan control, sensors, or other
hardware functions do not work correctly, what is the recommended debugging
and recovery process?

6. Validation and safety

=E2=80=A2 What validation checklist should be completed before enabling hos=
t power
control or testing other GPIO outputs?
=E2=80=A2 How should fan control and cooling failsafe behavior be validated=
 before
using the image on a live server?
=E2=80=A2 What are the minimum hardware details that must be verified befor=
e
proceeding with physical-board testing?

My current goal is to continue testing the image in QEMU, document the
confirmed and unverified hardware mappings, and determine the correct
procedure before flashing the physical board.

I would be grateful for any recommended documentation, reference
schematics, OpenBMC porting guides, practical experience, or advice from
engineers who have worked on similar BMC porting projects .

Thank you for your time and guidance.  please response or guide anyone to
take my step forward towards learning.

Best regards,
Kavya M M
