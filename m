Please correct me if I'm wrong but I'm still thinking that it is
possible. Also, I did compile it but dtc doesn't make a warning. Let me
show an another use case which is similar to this case:

In arch/arm/boot/dts/aspeed-g5.dtsi
[...]
lpc_host: lpc-host@80 {
         compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-lpc-host", "simple-mfd", "syscon";
         reg = <0x80 0x1e0>;
         reg-io-width = <4>;

         #address-cells = <1>;
         #size-cells = <1>;
         ranges = <0x0 0x80 0x1e0>;

         lpc_ctrl: lpc-ctrl@0 {
                 compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-lpc-ctrl";
                 reg = <0x0 0x80>;
                 clocks = <&syscon ASPEED_CLK_GATE_LCLK>;
                 status = "disabled";
         };

         lpc_snoop: lpc-snoop@0 {
                 compatible = "aspeed,ast2500-lpc-snoop";
                 reg = <0x0 0x80>;
                 interrupts = <8>;
                 status = "disabled";
         };
}
[...]

This is device tree setting for LPC interface and its child nodes.
LPC interface can be used as a multi-functional interface such as
snoop 80, KCS, SIO and so on. In this use case, lpc-ctrl@0 and
lpc-snoop@0 are sharing their address range from their individual
driver modules and they can be registered quite well through both
static dt or dynamic dtoverlay. PECI is also a multi-functional
interface which is similar to the above case, I think.

Thanks,

Jae
