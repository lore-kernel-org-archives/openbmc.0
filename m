Right, I somewhat forgot about the slave case.

Yup.

Right. Hammering with STOPs and pray ...

Well, there's a (small ?) chance that it's a controller bug asserting
the line so ... but there's little we can do if not.

Maybe. Or just "unrecoverable error"... hopefully these don't happen
too often ... We had cases of a TPM misbehaving like that.

No, not important, we can add that later if it ever becomes useful.

I replied privately ... as long as we ack before we start a new command
we should be ok but we shouldn't ack after.

Your latest patch still does that. It will do things like start a STOP
command *then* ack the status bits. I'm pretty sure that's bogus.

That way it's a lot simpler to simply move the

	writel(irq_status, bus->base + ASPEED_I2C_INTR_STS_REG);

To either right after the readl of the status reg at the beginning of
aspeed_i2c_master_irq().

I would be very surprised if that didn't work properly and wasn't much
safer than what you are currently doing. 

> Let me know if you still think we need a "RECOVERY" state.

The way you just switch to stop state and store the error for later
should work I think.

Not so much an RX, it's more like you are sending a 1-bit data in
the place of the Rd/Wr bit. So you have a read with a lenght of 0,
I don't think in that case you should set ASPEED_I2CD_M_RX_CMD in
__aspeed_i2c_do_start

Yes but we'd like the driver to work with both :-)

If you end up doing that, can you shoot it my way ? I can take care
of making sure it's all good for the 2400.

Yup. However, for the sake of getting something upstream (and in
OpenBMC 4.10 kernel) asap, I would suggest just dropping support
for those fast speeds for now, we can add them back later.

Ok. I noticed you missed that in v7, so I assume you mean v8 :-)
