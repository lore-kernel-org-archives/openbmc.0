If we have a subsystem in the future, then there would likely be an
associated binding which would be different. So if you update the DT,
then old kernels won't work with it.

One of experience. The one that stands out is clock bindings.
Initially we were doing a node per clock modelling which could end up
being 100s of nodes and is difficult to get right (with DT being an
ABI).

It comes up with system controller type blocks too that just have a
bunch of random registers. Those change in every SoC and not in any
controlled or ordered way that would make describing the individual
sub-functions in DT worthwhile.

Review.

If you look, register-bit-led is rarely used outside of some ARM, Ltd.
boards. It's simply quite rare to have MMIO register bits that have a
fixed function of LED control.

And this mux control is fixed in the SoC design?

Seems the controls are more fixed than I first thought. All the data
you have here could simply be within a driver. Help me understand what
functions are fixed (in the SoC) and which ones vary by board. Only
what's changing per board really needs to go into DT.
