Hi YH,

My main concern is trying to understand whether it is completely 
impossible (or introduces too much effort that we'd better not to take) 
integrating this to SPI subsystem.

 From your reply I understand there are two potential blockers:

a) Treating eSPI transfers as bus-level transfers (meaning that it will 
be necessary probably making separate driver for OOB/VW/Flash channels 
as they essentially use eSPI as a transport);

b) Some logic being done by the hardware (i.e. LPC bridge).

Please confirm my understanding:

(a) is feasible, but requires many effort to re-define architecture

(b) If something is done by the hardware - what is the driver impact? I 
recall eDAF use case when the driver wasn't involved at all - and flash 
access was fully done by the hardware (unless the controller is 
configured to handle it in SW mode).


P.S. I guess we can talk about host-BMC communication only when talking 
about hardware-dependent stuff (i.e. ast2600-espi files). eSPI core 
should be (it seems to be already is) at least BMC agnostic and this is 
the reason not having it under SOC/aspeed (ast2600-espi.* may stay here 
though).
