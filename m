Yes, the frame rate is the capture frame rate, unrelated to the host 
graphics output frame rate. It's really just a bandwidth-saving measure.

Yes, that's why I had those extra lines in set_format, so that if the 
set format resolution matches the actual frame size, then it can 
change... I guess I'm probably mis-using the API. Will look into the 
source event change and timings calls.

No problem!
