Ah yes. I do have code to make those "somewhat stable" using the chip
ID by default (unless overriden) as a backward compat thing for small
systems but the long term goal is indeed to not rely on this.

Yup, that's the right way actually :-)

No, it's for host "chips".

IE, this is the device-tree of the BMC, consumed by the BMC. So we are
in the context of Linux running on the BMC ARM SoC.

That BMC is connected to the "Host" POWER9 chips via a service
interface called FSI (think as a kind of PECI or JTAG on steroids),
which it uses to crank them up or do various monitoring/management
tasks.

So while they are CPUs they are actually "Devices" in the context of
the consumer here.

Additionally, on some systems, there can be other type of chips
connected to FSI, such as memory buffer chips etc... all get a "chip
ID" assigned.

There can be multiple FSI links connecting to the same chips, some are
accessed via cascaded FSI masters etc... so it's not about indices on
the bus. It's really about identifying a physical package on the
motherboard.

Yes, label would be an option too, probably a better one that aliases.

In a pretty much ad-hoc way :-) In this case, though, chip-id is a
simple solution and works well (and I have the code already written and
tested :-)
