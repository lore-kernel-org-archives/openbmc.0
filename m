I think, I already discussed about it with other reviewers but I have to
explain it again. Yes, PECI is yet not a popular interface but plays a
vital role in BMC system, so most of BMC chip vendors provide PECI
interface in their BMC chipsets, and it is the reason why the PECI
subsystem is added by this implementation because we should provide a
generic bus system for those BMC chipsets from multiple vendors so
that they can add their chip set specific driver to support that through
the generic interface. At this moment, the folder has only PECI core and
ASPEED PECI adapter drivers but other vendors' (i.e. Nuvoton) driver
could be added into the folder.

As you said, PECI's main purpose is Thermal Management but it's not
limited on that. As I already said in another thread and the cover
letter, PECI also can provide other sideband functions such as Platform
Manageability, Processor Tuning and Diagnostics and Failure Analysis.

AFAIK, only ARM core based BMC chipsets are rolled out so this
PECI implementation will be running on an ARM kernel at this moment.
It's not an x86 limited implementation.

Thanks,

Jae
