Hi,

Thanks for the feedback Guenter. I am about to put up a new patch set 
with fixes for many of the issues you indicated and better descriptions. 
Now all the attributes except two should conform to standard hwmon 
attributes. The exceptions are for the user power cap and user power cap 
source. These are needed in order to make decisions about power 
management while controlling the system. Please look at their 
documentation to see if they're acceptable.

Let me know what you think!
Thanks,
Eddie
