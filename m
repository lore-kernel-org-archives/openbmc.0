Hi Greg !

This adds support for offloading the FSI low level bitbanging to the
ColdFire coprocessor of the Aspeed SoCs. All the pre-requisites have
already been merged, this is the final piece in the puzzle.

This branch also pull gpio/ib-aspeed which is a topic branch already
in gpio/for-next (and thus in next) whic contains pre-requisites.

Finally, there's also a bug fix to the sbefifo driver for some
inconsistent use of a mutex in the error handling code.

Note: The oddball "origin" commit of that pull request comes from
the fact that Linus Walleij gpio/ib-aspeed tree is ahead of mine,
so pulling his branch pulled a bunch of already upstream other things
in. As such, i had to base this pull request off a local merge. This
shouldn't affect you at all, and allows the diffstat below to be
correct.

The bindings updates have been acked by Rob and the corresponding
device-tree updates will be merged by Joel via the ARM SoC tree.

Thanks !
Ben.
