Ok, I'll do that.

Hrm... originally vendor prefix on properties were for things that
didn't have a binding afaik. IE a way for an f-code driver to stash
things in the DT that were vendor specific and retrieve them from the
OS driver for example.

Here with well defined bindings it's rather bloaty don't you think ? I
don't strongly object to doing it, it's just a bit ... odd.

Cheers,
Ben.
