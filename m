Oops. I went a bit quick on this one I guess.

Anyhow, from a quick read of your comments I'm not sure if any of
them are such that we should revert.  Perhaps we Rick can prepare
a follow up patch covering them?  I got a little lost so am not
sure but if there is anything effecting bindings Rick, please
get this through asap or let me know if we need to revert for now.
Even if it is a case of adding a bit of binding and following up
with the code using it a bit later.

I'd asked for input on the clock stuff then forgot all about it on
the later version. Sorry about that!

Jonathan
