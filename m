Thank you for your response.

I have doubt  if I want to work on developing  OpenBMC  image for the
machine . do I really need schematics information or the firmware .bin
alone  file give the exacted all the information .
 What are all the tests need to done before uploading the generated image
into the physical chip.

Best regards.
Kavya

&gt;<br>
&gt; 1. What hardware documentation is normally required to develop a relia=
ble OpenBMC image for a new motherboard? Are the user manual and BMC refere=
nce schematic sufficient, or are the complete motherboard schematic and boa=
rd-specific signal mappings essential?<br>
&gt; 2. If the original BMC firmware is available only as a binary and the =
motherboard schematic is unavailable, what is the recommended approach for =
identifying the hardware configuration and developing the initial image?<br=
>
&gt; 3. Which existing OpenBMC reference platforms are suitable for beginne=
rs who want to learn the Yocto/BitBake build system, device trees, machine =
configuration, sensor integration, and required services?<br>
&gt; 4. Which hardware platforms provide good support for testing sensor mo=
nitoring, fan PWM/tachometer control, Redfish, GPIO, host power control, an=
d power sequencing?<br>
&gt; 5. Which functions can be tested in QEMU, and what hardware documentat=
ion and recovery facilities are necessary before proceeding with physical-b=
oard testing?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Request for Guidance on Restricted BMC SSH Access<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would also like to understand how to access the underlying Linux she=
ll on a BMC when SSH access is restricted by the vendor firmware.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; For example, some BMCs provide SSH access but expose only a restricted=
 interface, such as SMASH-CLP, instead of a standard Linux shell. In such c=
ases, what is the recommended and authorized method for accessing the under=
lying Linux environment for debugging, inspecting system configuration, and=
 understanding the running services?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Are there standard OpenBMC debugging methods or configuration options =
for enabling SSH shell access during development? If access is restricted b=
y the vendor firmware, what documentation or permissions would be required =
to investigate this further?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My current hardware<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I currently have access to a Gigabyte MZ32-AR0-00 motherboard with an =
ASPEED AST2500 BMC.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am considering using this board for my OpenBMC development. However,=
 I do not have access to the complete motherboard schematic, and some board=
-specific hardware mappings are difficult to confirm from the available doc=
umentation and original vendor firmware.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would appreciate your advice on whether this is a suitable platform =
for learning and developing OpenBMC, or whether a different, better-documen=
ted development platform would be a more practical starting point.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Request for development-board recommendations<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My budget for purchasing a BMC development board is approximately =E2=
=82=B95,000=E2=80=93=E2=82=B910,000.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Could you recommend a specific development board or server motherboard=
 that is affordable, well documented, and preferably has an existing upstre=
am OpenBMC machine configuration?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Ideally, I would like a platform that supports learning and testing:<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt; - OpenBMC image building using Yocto/BitBake.<br>
&gt; - Hardware sensor monitoring and integration.<br>
&gt; - Fan PWM/tachometer control and cooling failsafe behavior.<br>
&gt; - Redfish and other BMC management interfaces.<br>
&gt; - GPIO, host power control, and power sequencing.<br>
&gt; - QEMU-based software testing followed by physical-board validation.<b=
r>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My preference is for a platform with an existing reference implementat=
ion, accessible hardware documentation, and a reliable firmware recovery me=
thod. Used development boards or server motherboards would also be suitable=
 if they are available within my budget.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My goal is to choose the most practical platform, build and validate a=
n initial OpenBMC image, and gradually learn the hardware integration proce=
ss before attempting to flash a physical BMC.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I would be grateful for any recommendations on suitable hardware, exis=
ting reference platforms, documentation, or practical guidance from develop=
ers experienced in OpenBMC platform development.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Thank you for your time and support.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Best regards,<br>
&gt; Kavya M M<br>
