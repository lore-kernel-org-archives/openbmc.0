Seems reasonable to me to just expand the existing stuff to cover
reset as well, I don't think that should cause any issues for the
Arizona stuff.

The way I think we ended up looking at this was when a user
requests a GPIO the least surprising thing for them is the value
maintains until they change it again. So it made sense to make
the allowing the value to be dropped the opt in side.
