It's intended that nodes using the bindings I'm proposing are children of a 'compatible = "syscon", "simple-mfd"' node (this is the case with the features we're hoping to describe for our SoC). I should explicitly call that out.

I didn't intend for that to get interpreted quite as literally, so apologies for that. We do have h/w-block-specific compatibles in there too. The point was to demonstrate that we're dealing (at this point, only) with mfds/syscons.

If we shouldn't be describing minor features of a SoC in the devicetree, doesn't this invalidate the case for simple-mfd? What is the *correct* use of simple-mfd? When is it not used to expose minor features in set of "miscellaneous system registers"? Why doesn't this proposed case fit?

Ah, yes, this is a familiar feeling when reflecting on things I've done in the past. Hence trying to understand how to use it right.

Thanks for the clarification, I'll keep that in mind going forward.
