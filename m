Yeah, it's really a case-by-case basis. I'm really concerned about an
unmaintained piece of code in stable kernels, no one actually fixes bug
in it.

With the example here where that eval board was removed because no one
was using it is a great example of code we should be removing from
stable trees as well. If no one is using it - great! but if someone
does, then the removal should be reverted upstream as well.
