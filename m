Additionally, I need to explain that there is one and only bus host
(adapter) and multiple clients on a PECI bus, and PECI spec doesn't
allow multiple originators so only the host device can originate
message. In this implementation, all message transactions on a bus from
client driver modules and user space will be serialized well in the PECI
core bus driver so bus occupation and traffic arbitration will be
managed well in the PECI core bus driver even in case of a bus has 2 
client drivers at the same address. I'm sure that this implementation 
doesn't make that kind of problem to OS.
