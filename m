Implementing it by way of regulator support seems like it would make 
sense, but that in turn sounds like it would then end up just being a 
reimplementation of REGULATOR_USERSPACE_CONSUMER, which (unless there 
was some more subtle distinction that I missed) Mark already told me in 
no uncertain terms is not the way to go.  So I hope I could be forgiven 
for feeling a bit stuck here.

Mark, do you have any further input on what a viable approach might look 
like?


Thanks,
Zev
