There is little choice, we don't have the manpower to rewrite/upstream
all the drivers in a day, and rebasing to newer kernel takes time due
to various dependencies, testing requirements etc.

That being said, 4.13 is N-1, not too bad.

There are no vendor trees to speak of that we could merge. At least not
yet. We've been teaching vendors about doing proper drivers that can
work with upstream, device-tree based platforms etc... but it takes
time for them to get up to speed.

So while we are rewriting the drivers (sometimes with the vendor's
help), we keep a tree with the "sub-standard" ones hacked up to work on
our DT based platform and with our other bits and pieces until we can
ditch it.

It just takes time Greg. The original vendor drivers are in no shape to
get anywhere near upstream. They have to be mostly rewritten one by
one. Sometimes we can teach the vendor and help them along, some times
we do it ourselves, but it's a time consuming process. It took 2 or 3
kernel versions just to get the clk drivers that Joel had written
upstream for example. It took me a long time as well to get ftgmac100
sorted.

See my other email :)

We can't expect the community to rewrite the drivers for us. Some of
the clk and pinmux stuff is intrinsically very complex, and took time
(and we did get valuable feedback).

Now that these basic pieces of infrastructure are in, it's a matter of
tackling the remaining drivers one at a time.

There are no SoC trees per-se.

There is the OpenBMC tree which has hand-hacked vendor drivers plugged
into it, which are going away one at a time as we clean them up.
There's really one SoC family only in use (aspeed) at the moment with
one other coming around the corner (Nuvoton). For the latter, my
understanding is that we are trying to get the vendor to get their
stuff upstream directly.

Nah, not luck, we just need to get those drivers done one at a time,
it's not a matter of luck.

And I find git to be just fine :)
