For stream I/O you usually need 3 buffers: one is being DMAed, one is
the next queued up frame for the DMA and the third is being processed
in userspace. If userspace doesn't process buffers fast enough, then
the driver will need to capture into the same buffer over and over again
until userspace finally queues another buffer.

What I don't understand here is what the frame rate is. Is the capture
framerate the same as the host processor graphics output? Or is it
unrelated to that?

The problem with read() is that 1) it requires copying the video data, and
2) you cannot use dmabuf for zero-copying pipelines. Whether or not 2 is
needed depends on your hardware.

You are capturing the host graphics output, right? So you need to know
the resolution, timings, etc. of that output? What if the host changes
resolution? That's something you need to know, or am I missing something?

This is obviously a somewhat different environment than what I am used to,
so bear with me if I ask stupid questions...
