Thanks a lot for your help on reviewing this patch series. I'll submit
v11 to address your comments. We could ask Greg to queue it then.

Agreed. I'll add a comment like you suggested.

Yes, that would be neater. Will fix it.

Okay, I'll check all comments again in this series.

The msg->tx_len is already checked by callers - peci_ioctl_wr_pkg_cfg()
and peci_ioctl_wr_pci_cfg_local() - so it's not needed to be checked
again at here.

The tx_buf will be initialized only amounts it needs to be in each
command. The adapter->xfer is handling exactly up to msg->tx_len so
it would be better keep the current code without using zeroing out the
struct.

Since it supports only 'intel,peci-client' for now, it's not needed
actually. I'll drop it at this time. It would be added later if needed.

Right, I'll fix it using of_property_read_u32.

Oh, this code is definitely incorrect. I should to put the of_node
reference at here if peci_new_device() fails and should keep the
reference until peci_unregister_device() is called. Will fix it.
Thank you for your pointing it out!

This is incorrect too. Will move the of_node_get/put code into
peci_new_device() and peci_unregister_device() to avoid confusion.
Thanks again for your pointing it out. :)
