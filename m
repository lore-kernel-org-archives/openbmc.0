Actually, I wouldn't have a separate "openbmc mode".  I would have 
OpenBMC always
work with standard SSIF, and have separate SMBus commands for messages with
the sequence number and messages larger than 32 bytes.

I've attached a patch with what I would expect the changes to be to the 
host driver.
It doesn't handle multiple outstanding messages, but it shows what 
detection and a
separate SMBus command would look like.

I'm not sure IPMB would make much difference, there's no host side 
change as it's
already supported.  I don't think there would be any significant code 
sharing
between the two.

If there end up being a significant amount of common code, then it would
definitely be worth the effort to move it.

You can look at the patch and consider it, and consider that you would 
need to
implement flag and event handling.  On an x86 host there would be SMBIOS
and ACPI stuff to deal with somehow for discovery.  There's probably few 
other
things to deal with.

Let's hold off on the new directory, there's probably some convincing of 
the "powers
that be" for that.

I'll look at the patch set tomorrow, unless something critical comes up.

Thanks,
