I still think it would be best to provide an option to specify the timeout value
it in the device tree regardless of master mode or not. Also, I am talking about
fairness arbitration not the physical level arbitration provided by the I2C
spec. The physical arbitration that Aspeed provides just allows multiple masters
to operate on the same bus according to the specification; this bus arbitration
does not guarantee forward progress or even guarentee that the actual message
will be sent, which is what you are trying to do here.

Since you are planning on implementing IPMB, you will probably need to implement
fairness arbitration. I am not familiar with your BMC-ME channel. It sounds like
it pre-dates MCTP, so it must implement its own fairness arbitration on top of
the IPMB layer (more like you bake in some assumptions about what the possible
state is at anytime that guarentee fairness).

Are you using the Aspeed BMC on both sides of the connection? If so, you might
be further ahead to implement MCTP fairness arbitration which can be used in
conjunction with IPMB. This will require a bit of work to do, but everyone will
be much happier in the long term (assuming MCTP does eventually become a thing).
