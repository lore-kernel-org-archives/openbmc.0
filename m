Can we separate the list of what's enabled from the details of the
registers?  Even if we put all this into DT, we may still want to have
some separation for dts file structure. Some portion of this has to be
SoC specific because you are simply exposing SoC registers.

That's very hand wavy. Do you have some concrete examples (i.e. dts
files) showing the differences.

One problem I'm having with this is you are still going to need per
board specifics in userspace. You may be moving some of details out,
but moving to DT is not going to completely eliminate that. I agree
that not using /dev/mem is a good thing, but there are several ways
you could do that independent of any DT binding.

Sadly, updating my kernel is easier than updating my PC firmware
(though packaged firmware on my current laptop changes that). I can
assure you that ARM boards are generally much worse in that regard.
BTW, you may want to pay attention to EBBR[1][2]. Not sure how much
you care for BMCs, but there may be some interest.
