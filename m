Yes, it seems to be an issue with the timing of the video engine 
interrupts compared with how a normal v4l2 application queues buffers. 
With the simple read() application, the driver can swap between DMA 
buffers freely and get a frame ahead. With the streaming buffers, I 
found the driver ran through the queue quite quickly, but then, once 
userspace queues again, we had to wait for the next frame, as I couldn't 
get a frame ahead since no buffers were available during that time 
period. This could possibly be solved with more buffers but this gets to 
require a lot of memory, since each buffer is allocated for the full 
frame size even though we only fill a fraction of it with JPEG data...

Sure thing. Thanks for the guidance.

OK I see. I ended up simplifying this part anyway since it's not 
possible to change the video size from the driver. I don't think there 
is a need for VIDIOC_QUERY_DV_TIMINGS now, but feel free to review.

Thanks again,
Eddie
