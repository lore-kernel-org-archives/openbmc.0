Okay then, I think, we can fix the timeout value to 100ms and enable the
bus busy checking logic only when 'multi-master' is set in device tree.
My thought is, no additional arbitration logic is needed because
arbitration is performed in H/W level and H/W reports
ASPEED_I2CD_INTR_ARBIT_LOSS when it fails acquiring a bus. The
ARBIT_LOSS event is already being handled well by this driver code you
implemented.

Yes, that sucks but that is Aspeed's I2C IP behavior and that's the
reason why they implemented some combination bits handling code in
their SDK. Actually, the cases are happening somewhat frequently
but that would not be a problem if we handle the cases properly instead
of making error out or warn.

Okay, I'll check it with Aspeed. Will let you know their response.

Yes, I'm implementing IPMB for a BMC-ME channel. As I said above,
arbitration will be performed in H/W level and it's already been handled
well by your code. This bus busy checking logic is for checking whether
any slave operation is currently ongoing or not at the timing of
master_xfer is called. It's not for arbitration but for preventing state
conflicts between master and slave operations.

FYI, I broke down this patch into smaller patches you reviewed
Today. Thanks for sharing your time for reviewing the patches.
I'll send remaining patches after completing review on those
patches because the remaining patches have dependency on them.

Thanks!
