Hi, thanks for the quick response!

There is actually no PCIe configuration done in this driver. The two 
sysfs entries control the system control unit (SCU) on the AST2500 
purely to enable and disable entire PCIe devices. It might be possible 
to control those devices more finely with a PCI endpoint driver, but 
there is no need to do so. The XDMA engine does that by itself to 
perform DMA fairly automatically.

If the sysfs entries are really troublesome, we can probably remove 
those and find another way to control the SCU.

Right, I did look into the normal DMA framework. There were a couple of 
problems. First and foremost, the "device" (really, host processor) 
address that we use is 64 bit, but the AST2500 is of course 32 bit. So I 
couldn't find a good way to get the address through the DMA API into the 
driver. It's entirely possible I missed something there though.

The other issue was that the vast majority of the DMA framework was 
unused, resulting in a large amount of boilerplate that did nothing 
except satisfy the API... I thought simplicity would be better in this case.

Let me know what you think... I could certainly switch to ioctl instead 
of the write() if that's better. Or if you really think the DMA 
framework is required here, let me know.

Thanks,

Eddie

Understood, thanks.
