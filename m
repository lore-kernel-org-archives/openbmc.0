drivers/watchdog/npcm_wdt.c contradicts that statement.

Please discuss with the pwm maintainer. In hwmon, wildcards in driver file
names are discouraged and will not be accepted. Our recommendation is to pick
one chip from the family and use it as part of the file name.

That depends on how closely the two modules are intertwined. If the pwm module
is generic, it belongs into the pwm subsystem. It only belongs into hwmon
if it can _only_ be used for fan control, eg if the data reported by the fan
module is used by the hardware to control the pwm output based on some
fan speed <-> pw value mapping which is programmed into the chip, and/or
if the pwm output can only connect to a fan and nothing else, and if the
relationship between pwm output and fan input is well defined.

If both end up in hwmon, I don't see the benefit of having two separate
drivers. That means two hwmon devices for the same fan or set of fans,
one being all but useless in respect to output from the 'sensors'
command. You'll have to convince me why that would make sense; I just
don't see the point.  In that case, I would also not see the point of
having two separate devicetree nodes; to me, that would be similar
to having two interfaces for a single serial line, one for receive
and one for transmit.

No problem with that as long as there are no wildcards in the file name.
