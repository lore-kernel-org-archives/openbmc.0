Andrew, Ben, first of all let me thank you for bringing in this set of
patches.

=46rom the discussion it looks to me like Rob is not familiar with
specifics of BMC-managed servers and tries to apply to them the rules
that have proven to be good for workstations and laptops.

As someone using /dev/mem these days to configure those registers in
BMCs, I'm all for this patch set as it will make BMC configuration less
obscure. Writing 1 or 0 to a named node is way clearer than writing some
magic value at some magic offset in /dev/mem. I like the idea of having
it all configurable via DT as it allows for only having exported the
nodes that are actually needed, thus reducing, as you have said, the
foot-gun.

So far I do not have any objections or constructive comments to the
architecture of the proposed patches.

So I'm writing this to support your position in this discussion and to
let Rob and other reviewers know that this feature is actually needed.

With best regards,
Alexander Amelkin
