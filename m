Hello,

TLDR: I dropped v2 from my tree due to build issues with SPI
controllers which I forgot about due to my testing configuration being
minimal. This is just a respin of the same series, fixing the spi
controller drivers which I initially missed.

SPI NAND continuous read support has already been added a few releases
ago, but only Macronix chips were benefiting from this support. Winbond
chips also have a continuous read feature, which is slightly more
complex to use in the scope of the Linux kernel, because they these
chips expect a different read from cache operation once in continuous
mode.

In order to be more flexible, this series changes the logic behind
dirmaps. Direct mappings used to be very static, not flexible. I am
proposing to change this and turn them in to slightly more dynamic
interfaces, where for instance we can:
- Enable/disable the correction (was previously handled by creating yet
  another pair of direct mappings per target).
- Select one or another variant for the cache operations.

I propose to name the variants available in a direct mapping "primary"
and "secondary", and let the upper layer (SPI NOR or SPI NAND) point to
the one that needs to be used for the operation. Controller drivers
should not really care about this change, expect the fact that they
should not keep a static representation of the template on their
side. Because of that, I am creating a capability boolean to flag
drivers that support this capability (the flag is ignored in the
nodirmap case).

This series is now sent as v2 following a former RFC (link below).

Here is a benchmark with the faster Winbond chip I have, W35N02JW on a
TI AM62a7 LP SK featuring the Cadence QSPI controller, clocked at
25MHz. Speed gain for a 10-page read is about +32% in octal SDR mode,
+47% for a 10-page read in octal DTR mode and up to +83% for a entire
block read!

    1S-8S-8S, no continuous read:

       64 page read speed is 15058 KiB/s

    1S-8S-8S, with continuous reads:

       1 page read speed is 15058 KiB/s
       2 page read speed is 15058 KiB/s
       3 page read speed is 16800 KiB/s
       4 page read speed is 17066 KiB/s
       5 page read speed is 18461 KiB/s
       6 page read speed is 18461 KiB/s
       7 page read speed is 19384 KiB/s
       8 page read speed is 19692 KiB/s
       9 page read speed is 19384 KiB/s
       10 page read speed is 20000 KiB/s
       11 page read speed is 20000 KiB/s
       12 page read speed is 20000 KiB/s
       13 page read speed is 20800 KiB/s
       14 page read speed is 20363 KiB/s
       15 page read speed is 20000 KiB/s
       16 page read speed is 19692 KiB/s
       32 page read speed is 19692 KiB/s
       64 page read speed is 19692 KiB/s

    8D-8D-8D, no continuous read:

       64 page read speed is 23272 KiB/s

    8D-8D-8D, with continuous read:

       1 page read speed is 23272 KiB/s
       2 page read speed is 23272 KiB/s
       3 page read speed is 28000 KiB/s
       4 page read speed is 32000 KiB/s
       5 page read speed is 34285 KiB/s
       6 page read speed is 34285 KiB/s
       7 page read speed is 36000 KiB/s
       8 page read speed is 36571 KiB/s
       9 page read speed is 36000 KiB/s
       10 page read speed is 34285 KiB/s
       11 page read speed is 36666 KiB/s
       12 page read speed is 40000 KiB/s
       13 page read speed is 41600 KiB/s
       14 page read speed is 37333 KiB/s
       15 page read speed is 40000 KiB/s
       16 page read speed is 36571 KiB/s
       32 page read speed is 42666 KiB/s
       64 page read speed is 42666 KiB/s

On the Nuvoton platform, the speed gain is real, even though it is less
impressive:

       1 page read speed is 1802 KiB/s
       2 page read speed is 1882 KiB/s
       3 page read speed is 1938 KiB/s
       4 page read speed is 1939 KiB/s
       5 page read speed is 1935 KiB/s
       6 page read speed is 1967 KiB/s
       7 page read speed is 1968 KiB/s
       8 page read speed is 1969 KiB/s
       9 page read speed is 1968 KiB/s
       10 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       11 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       12 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       13 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       14 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       15 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       16 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       32 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s
       64 page read speed is 2000 KiB/s

Thanks!

Changes in v3:
- The API change in spi-mem has been applied to all SPI controller drivers
  (fixing build failures on drivers I was not building in my test
  config).
  That is the only change.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20260326-winbond-v6-18-rc1-cont-read-v2-0-643de97a68a3@bootlin.com

Changes in v2:
- Rebased on v7.0-rc1.
- Collected tags.
- I manually tested the integrity of the data by manually disabling all
  possible variants one after the other using a 2 page read scenario. All
  worked except the fastest 8D-8D-8D variant (the first one in the list)
  which triggered the CS deassert issue on the Cadence controller. This
  issue is orthogonal to this patchset, a follow-up series will be sent
  to disable continuous reads on this controller.
- All continuous read variants for the W25NxxJW chips have been tested
  on the MA35D1 platform (which lead to several fixes) and the
  W35NxxJW chips have been tested on TI AM62a7 LP SK.
- Several changes have been operated in the core to stabilize the
  feature when a secondary op is used.
- A couple of helpers have been created to cleanup the winbond.c driver.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20251205-winbond-v6-18-rc1-cont-read-v1-0-01bc48631c73@bootlin.com
