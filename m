It helps in debugging. Basically you are implementing a receiver for a
video signal. So if for some reason you cannot support the video timings
that the host sends, then it is very useful to have QUERY_DV_TIMINGS report
as much information about the signal as possible.

BTW, out of curiosity, how are the host video signals connected to the
aspeed? Is it still a VGA video signal?

Looking at product briefs it appears that it is VGA. So I guess the aspeed
'sniffs' the VGA signals from the host and can capture the video that way.
Is that correct?

If so, then this driver is a VGA receiver and should act like that.
The host can configure its VGA transmitter to invalid timings, or weird
values, and you need to be able to handle that in your driver.

No problem! Happy to help.
