Hi Julia,

Thanks for sharing your time on reviewing it. Please see my inline answers.

I intended to show that this function has a mutex locking inside for 
serialization of PECI data transactions from multiple callers, but as 
you commented out below, the mutex protection scope should be adjusted 
to make that covers the peci_scan_cmd_mask() function too. I'll rewrite 
the mutex protection scope then this function will be in the locked scope.

I agree with you. I'll move this code into the peci_register_adapter() 
function.

Thanks for letting me know that. I'll drop that checking code and 
might_sleep() too.

Sure. I'll split it out.

Yes, I'm pretty sure. The first byte contains a PECI command value and 
the second byte contains 'HostID[7:1] & Retry[0]' value.

Agreed. That would be neater. Will rewrite it. Thanks!

Thanks for the pointing it out. This function should be done in a locked 
scope as you said. I'll adjust mutex protection scope to make that 
covers this function as well.

Agreed. I'll drop all individual calls from subfunctions and will call 
it from peci_command().

Generally, an adapter driver registration will be happened after the 
PECI bus registration because peci_init uses postcore_initcall, but in 
case of incorrect implementation of an adapter driver which uses
a preceding postcore_initcall or a core_initcall as its module init, 
then an adapter registration would be prior to bus registration. This 
code is an exceptional case handling for that to warn the incorrect 
adapter driver implementation.

It should be a packed struct because it is also being used for CRC8 
calculation which is treating it as a contiguous byte array.

Currently this implementation has only a temperature monitoring sideband 
feature but other sideband features such as CPU error detection and 
crash dump will be implemented later, and those additional sideband 
features should have higher priority than the temperature monitoring 
feature so it is the reason why I used an rt_mutex.

Agreed. That would be more helpful for debugging in debug build. I'll 
rewrite the macro to a static inline like below:

static inline struct peci_adapter *to_peci_adapter(void *d)
{
	return container_of(d, struct peci_adapter, dev);
}
